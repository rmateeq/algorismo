### Transcripts for the Video Explaining the Complexity Concept (with Additional Points)

"Hi everyone! In this video, we're going to tackle the exercise that builds on our 'Find Max' algorithm. We'll develop the solution step by step and understand the concept of algorithm complexity in a simple and accessible way."

"Let's start with the exercise. We have a function `find_max` that needs to find the maximum number in a list and count the number of steps it takes to do so. We will focus on the steps that are influenced by the size of the input. Let's go through the find_max function to understand which lines are influenced by the input size and which are not."

The first line defines the function and is not influenced by the input size. It executes only once when the function is called regardless of the size of the input list.

The third line initializes the `max_number` variable with the first element of the list. It is a single operation and executes only once no matter what the size of the input list is.

The fourth line starts a loop that iterates through each element in the list. The number of iterations is directly influenced by the size of the input list. For a list of size 10, loop will run 10 times and 20 times for a list of size 20. In general, for a list of size n, the loop will run n times.

Lines six and seven are also influenced by the length of list because these are part of the loop. Therefore, this loop is where we need to count the steps.
We’ll use different lists as input and observe the change in the count of `steps` with changing input size."

Let's first define and initialize a variable `steps` to 0 at the beginning of our function:
```python
steps = 0
```
Now, we increment this variable inside our loop for each element checked. The comments clearly explain these TODOs.

```python
    # Increment steps here
    steps += 1
```
The last line returns the max_number found. It is a single operation and is not influenced by any change in the size of the input list.

Since `return` is the last statement executed in the function, we print the number of steps taken to find the maximum number before it here.

Let’s use the following lists as input one at a time and count the steps:
```python
# Variation 1: Small list
sample_numbers = [5, 3, 9, 1, 6]
print("The maximum number is:", find_max(sample_numbers))
```
This first list has 5 numbers and once we excute the code with this list as input, we can see that the number of steps are also 5.
```
# Variation 2: Larger list
# sample_numbers = [8, 2, 10, 4, 7, 1, 12, 14, 3, 6]
# print("The maximum number is:", find_max(sample_numbers))
```
The next list has 10 numbers, and the number of steps to find the max number are also 10 in this case.
```
# Variation 3: Even larger list
# sample_numbers = [15, 3, 9, 8, 22, 4, 13, 2, 11, 17, 1, 19, 6, 18, 7, 20, 5, 14, 10, 21, 16, 12]
# print("The maximum number is:", find_max(sample_numbers))
```
This last list has 22 numbers in it and passing it to `find_max` takes 22 steps in finding the maximum number.


In general, for each list, the number of steps taken by the algorithm is equal to the number of elements in the list. This is because the algorithm iterates through each element once to find the maximum number. Steps like initializing `max_number` and `steps` are not influenced by the input size, but the looping and comparisons are.

We can generalize to conclude that for a list of size `n`, the algorithm will take `n` steps because it needs to examine each element once to determine the maximum. This linear relationship between the input size and the number of steps taken is what we refer to as **linear complexity**, often denoted as O(n). 

 While this may seem intuitive, you may have question like
- why we use notation O(n) and not just n, or
- why are we talking about input size only and not other factors like processing and memory speeds etc, or
- why we counted the step inside the loop as one and why did we ignore the count for the if statement and updating the max_number.
Don't worry about these details, we shall slowly but surely answer these questions too.

That's all for now. Thank you for watching and joining me on this journey through algorithms. Don’t forget to try this exercise with different lists and observe the step counts yourself. Share your thoughts and questions in the comments. See you next time for our next lesson. Happy coding!
