### Transcripts for the Video Explaining the Complexity Concept (with Additional Points)

**Introduction:**

"Hi everyone! In this video, we're going to tackle an exercise that builds on our 'Find Max' algorithm. We'll develop the solution step by step and understand the concept of algorithm complexity in a simple and accessible way."

**Slide 1: Presenting the Exercise**

"Let's start with the exercise. We have a function `find_max` that needs to find the maximum number in a list and count the number of steps it takes to do so. We will focus on the steps that are influenced by the size of the input, highlighting which steps are and are not influenced by it."

**Slide 2: Reviewing the Initial Code**

"Here’s our initial code for the `find_max` function:
```python
def find_max(numbers):
  # Define and initialize a variable `steps` to 0
  max_number = numbers[0]
  for number in numbers:
    # Increment steps here
    if number > max_number:
      max_number = number
  # Print steps here
  return max_number
```
We’ll use different lists as input and observe the change in the count of `steps` with changing input size."

**Slide 3: Adding Step Counting**

"First, we need to count the number of steps. Let’s define and initialize a variable `steps` to 0 at the beginning of our function:
```python
steps = 0
```
We increment this variable inside our loop for each element checked."

**Slide 4: Modifying the Code**

"Now, let’s modify our code to include step counting:
```python
def find_max(numbers):
  # Define and initialize a variable `steps` to 0
  steps = 0
  max_number = numbers[0]
  for number in numbers:
    # Increment steps here
    steps += 1
    if number > max_number:
      max_number = number
  # Print steps here
  print("It took", steps, "steps to find the maximum number from a list of", len(numbers), "numbers")
  return max_number
```
We also print the number of steps taken to find the maximum number."

**Slide 5: Running the Function with Different Lists**

"Let’s use the following lists as input one at a time and count the steps:
```python
# Variation 1: Small list
sample_numbers = [5, 3, 9, 1, 6]
print("The maximum number is:", find_max(sample_numbers))

# Variation 2: Larger list
# sample_numbers = [8, 2, 10, 4, 7, 1, 12, 14, 3, 6]
# print("The maximum number is:", find_max(sample_numbers))

# Variation 3: Even larger list
# sample_numbers = [15, 3, 9, 8, 22, 4, 13, 2, 11, 17, 1, 19, 6, 18, 7, 20, 5, 14, 10, 21, 16, 12]
# print("The maximum number is:", find_max(sample_numbers))
```
Observe the change in the step count with different input sizes. Remember, we are focusing on the steps influenced by the size of the input."

**Slide 6: Explaining the Step Counts**

"For each list, the number of steps taken by the algorithm is equal to the number of elements in the list. This is because the algorithm iterates through each element once to find the maximum number. Steps like initializing `max_number` and `steps` are not influenced by the input size, but the looping and comparisons are.

For example:
- For the list `[5, 3, 9, 1, 6]`, there are 5 elements, so it takes 5 steps.
- For the list `[8, 2, 10, 4, 7, 1, 12, 14, 3, 6]`, there are 10 elements, so it takes 10 steps.
- For the list `[15, 3, 9, 8, 22, 4, 13, 2, 11, 17, 1, 19, 6, 18, 7, 20, 5, 14, 10, 21, 16, 12]`, there are 22 elements, so it takes 22 steps."

**Slide 7: Generalizing the Steps**

"In general, for a list of size `n`, the algorithm will take `n` steps because it needs to examine each element once to determine the maximum. While this may seem intuitive, understanding why the input size affects the number of steps will be unraveled later.

This linear relationship between the input size and the number of steps taken is what we refer to as **linear complexity**, often denoted as O(n). We’ll explain why we call it O(n) in more detail later."

**Slide 8: Summary**

"To summarize:
- We modified our `find_max` function to count the number of steps.
- We observed that the number of steps is equal to the number of elements in the list.
- This illustrates the concept of linear complexity, where the time taken by the algorithm scales linearly with the input size.

Understanding this concept helps us evaluate the efficiency of our algorithms and is a fundamental part of learning how to program effectively."

**Closing**
