### Transcripts for the Video Explaining the Solution to Exercise

**Show find_max_exercise.py**:
Hi everyone! In this video, we're going to tackle the exercise that builds on our 'Find Max' algorithm. We'll develop the solution step by step and understand the concept of algorithm complexity in a simple and accessible way.

Let's start with the exercise. We have a function `find_max` that needs to find the maximum number in a list and count the number of steps it takes to do so. We will focus on the steps that are influenced by the size of the input. Let's go through the `find_max` function to understand which lines are influenced by the input size and which are not.

**In PythonTutor find_max_exercise.py**

- Line 1 defines the function and is not influenced by the input size. It executes only once when the function is called regardless of the size of the input list.
- Line 3 initializes the `max_number` variable with the first element of the list. It is a single operation and executes only once no matter what the size of the input list is.

- Line 4 starts a loop that iterates through each element in the list. The number of iterations is directly influenced by the size of the input list. For a list of size 10, the loop will run 10 times, and for a list of size 20, it will run 20 times. In general, for a list of size `n`, the loop will run `n` times.
- Lines 6 and 7 are also influenced by the length of the list because they are part of the loop. Therefore, this loop is the part of code where we need to count the steps.

**Editing Code**

Let's first define and initialize a variable `steps` to 0 at the beginning of our function:
```python
steps = 0
```
Now, we increment this variable inside our loop for each element checked. The comments clearly explain these TODOs."

"Next, we add the step counting inside the loop:
```python
    # Increment steps here
    steps += 1
```
The last line returns the `max_number` found. It is a single operation and is not influenced by any change in the size of the input list."

"Since `return` is the last statement executed in the function, we print the number of steps taken to find the maximum number before it here."

**Running the Function with Different Lists**

"To demonstrate, we’ll use different lists as input and observe the change in the count of `steps` with changing input size."
"Let’s use the first list with 5 numbers as input one at a time and count the steps:
```python
# Variation 1: Small list
sample_numbers = [5, 3, 9, 1, 6]
print("The maximum number is:", find_max(sample_numbers))
```
**Press Visualize and Press End**
Once we execute the code with this list as input, we can see that the number of steps is 5.

**Go Back to Edit**
The next list has 10 numbers
```python
# Variation 2: Larger list
# sample_numbers = [8, 2, 10, 4, 7, 1, 12, 14, 3, 6]
# print("The maximum number is:", find_max(sample_numbers))
```
**Press Visualize and Press End**
On executing, the number of steps to find the max number is also 10 in this case.

**Go Back to Edit**
The third and last list has 22 numbers
```python
# Variation 3: Even larger list
# sample_numbers = [15, 3, 9, 8, 22, 4, 13, 2, 11, 17, 1, 19, 6, 18, 7, 20, 5, 14, 10, 21, 16, 12]
# print("The maximum number is:", find_max(sample_numbers))
```
**Press Visualize and Press End**
Passing this list to `find_max` takes 22 steps to find the maximum number."

**Explaining the Step Counts**

"In general, for each list, the number of steps taken by the algorithm is equal to the number of elements in the list. This is because the algorithm iterates through each element once to find the maximum number. Steps like initializing or returning the `max_number` are not influenced by the input size, but the looping and comparisons are."

"We can generalize to conclude that for a list of size `n`, the algorithm will take `n` steps because it needs to examine each element once to determine the maximum. This linear relationship between the input size and the number of steps taken is what we refer to as **linear complexity**, often denoted as O(n).

While this may seem intuitive, you might have questions like:
- Why do we use the notation O(n) and not just `n`?
- Why are we talking about input size only and not other factors like processing and memory speeds?
- Why did we count the step inside the loop as one and ignore the count for the `if` statement and updating the `max_number`?

Don't worry about these details; we shall slowly but surely answer these questions too."

**Closing**

"That's all for now. Thank you for watching and joining me on this journey through algorithms. Don’t forget to try this exercise with different lists and observe the step counts yourself. Share your thoughts and questions in the comments. See you next time for our next lesson. Happy coding!"
