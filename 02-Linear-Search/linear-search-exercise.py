# index_1, steps_1 = linear_search(numbers, target_1)
# index_2, steps_2 = linear_search(numbers, target_2)
# index_3, steps_3 = linear_search(numbers, target_3)

# Print explicit messages for each case (To be implemented by the learner)
# Example:
# print(f"Best case: Target {target_1} found at the beginning (index {index_1}) with {steps_1} steps.")
# print(f"Worst case: Target {target_2} found at the end (index {index_2}) with {steps_2} steps.")
# print(f"Average case: Target {target_3} found in the middle (index {index_3}) with {steps_3} steps.")
